# CEO Speech Sentimental Analysis

Many companies share their financial results for a quarter or a year through earning calls and reports. 
It is a way to communicate with shareholders about the company’s performance and strategy for the future. 
Although, the full report with all the numbers and plans is a good way to look at company's present and future, 
the important part of this earning call is a speech by the CEO/CFO where they highlight company’s progress and answer some questions by investors.
Your mission, should you choose to accept, is to analyze earning call speech by a CEO of a company.
